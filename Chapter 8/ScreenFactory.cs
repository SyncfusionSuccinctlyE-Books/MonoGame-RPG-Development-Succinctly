            // This lets you still take advantage of constructor arguments yet participate in the
            // serialization process of the screen manager. Of course you need to save out those
            // values when deactivating and read them back, but that means either IsolatedStorage or
            // using the PhoneApplicationService.Current.State dictionary.
