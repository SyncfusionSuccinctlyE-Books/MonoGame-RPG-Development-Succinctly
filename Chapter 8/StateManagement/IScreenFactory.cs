{
    // Defines an object that can create a screen when given its type.
    // 
    // The ScreenManager attempts to handle tombstoning on Windows Phone by creating an XML
    // document that has a list of the screens currently in the manager. When the game is
    // reactivated, the ScreenManager needs to create instances of those screens. However
    // since there is no restriction that a particular GameScreen subclass has a parameterless
    // constructor, there is no way the ScreenManager alone could create those instances.
    // 
    // IScreenFactory fills this gap by providing an interface the game should implement to
    // act as a translation from type to instance. The ScreenManager locates the IScreenFactory
    // from the Game.Services collection and passes each screen type to the factory, expecting
    // to get the correct GameScreen out.
    // 
    // If your game screens all have parameterless constructors, the minimal implementation of
    // this interface would look like this:
    // 
    // return Activator.CreateInstance(screenType) as GameScreen;
    // 
    // If you have screens with constructors that take arguments, you will need to ensure that
    // you can read these arguments from storage or generate new ones, then construct the screen
    // based on the type.
    // 
    // The ScreenFactory type in the sample game has the minimal implementation along with some
    // extra comments showing a potentially more complex example of how to implement IScreenFactory.

        GameScreen CreateScreen(Type screenType);
